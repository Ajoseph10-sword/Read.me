The choose your own adventure activity helped to explore my creativity and expand my knowldege of mythical dieties, knowledge of RPGs, and data science
Some wishes that I have for this activity were adding more content to this adventure like a command selection from a RPG and even more gods to pick from
I also wished that I could give each god a character-specific substory so that the experience would feel unique.
In summary, I enjoyed making this interactive and wish to do more assignments like this
